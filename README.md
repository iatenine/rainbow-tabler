# Description

# Installation

Rainbow Tabler is designed to be run locally and, for security purposes, ignores
hash outputs by default

You'll need the following installed to successfully run the program:

- Node
- NPM

After cloning this repo, run `npm i` to install dependencies and launch the program
by running `node index.js`

# Usage

Before running this project, configure the code to read in hashes from the
database you'd like to test. Currently a lot of manual coding is required
though over time a more intuitive UI may be released in future iterations

# Contributing

If there's a feature you'd like to see or bug that needs to be fixed,
please open an issue to inform other users. As with all open-source,
support cannot be guaranteed but the odds of feature integration increases
with the effort put into the issue. Issues that are attached to PRs
have the best chances of coming to fruition
